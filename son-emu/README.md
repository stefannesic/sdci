# son-emu/vim-emu: A NFV multi-PoP emulation platform

This emulation platform was created to support network service developers to locally prototype and test their network services in realistic end-to-end multi-PoP scenarios. It allows the execution of real network functions, packaged as Docker containers, in emulated network topologies running locally on the developer's machine. The emulation platform also offers OpenStack-like APIs for each emulated PoP so that it can integrate with MANO solutions, like OSM. The core of the emulation platform is based on [Containernet](https://containernet.github.io).

The original project was called `son-emu` and later renamed to `vim-emu` when the emulator was adopted by the OSM project. We keep the repository name `son-emu` to not break existing links in publications.

The emulation platform `vim-emu` is developed as part of OSM's DevOps MDG.

### Note

This repository is a fork of the [original vim-emu](https://osm.etsi.org/gitweb/?p=osm/vim-emu.git;a=summary) repository that is hosted by ETSI OSM. You can find the (deprecated) SONATA master branch in [sonata/master](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu/tree/sonata/master).

### Acknowledgments

This software was originally developed by the [SONATA project](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu), funded by the European Commission under grant number 671517 through the Horizon 2020 and 5G-PPP programs. The development of this software is now also supported by the [5GTANGO project](https://5gtango.eu), funded by the European Commission under grant number H2020-ICT-2016-2 761493 through the Horizon 2020 and 5G-PPP programs.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install and use the emulation platform. The bare-metal installation requires a freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and is done by an ansible playbook. Another option is to use a nested Docker environment to run the emulator inside a Docker container.

### Manual installation

#### Option 1: Bare-metal installation

```sh
sudo apt-get install ansible git aptitude
```

##### Step 1. Containernet installation

```sh
cd
git clone https://github.com/containernet/containernet.git
cd ~/containernet/ansible
sudo ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local install.yml
```

##### Step 2. vim-emu installation

```sh
cd
git clone https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu
cd ~/son-emu/ansible
sudo ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local install.yml
```

#### Option 2: Nested Docker Deployment
This option requires a Docker installation on the host machine on which the emulator should be deployed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-emu
cd ~/son-emu
# build the container:
docker build -t vim-emu-img .
# run the (interactive) container:
docker run --name vim-emu -it --rm --privileged --pid='host' -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock vim-emu-img /bin/bash
```


## Usage

### Example

This simple example shows how to start the emulator with a simple topology (terminal 1) and how to start (terminal 2) some empty VNF containers in the emulated datacenters (PoPs) by using the vim-emu CLI.

* First terminal (start the emulation platform):
    * `sudo python examples/default_single_dc_topology.py`
* Second terminal (use `docker exec vim-emu <command>` for nested Docker deployment):
    * `vim-emu compute start -d dc1 -n vnf1`
    * `vim-emu compute start -d dc1 -n vnf2`
    * `vim-emu compute list`
* First terminal:
    * `containernet> vnf1 ifconfig`
    * `containernet> vnf1 ping -c 2 vnf2`

A more advanced example that includes OSM can be found in the [official vim-emu documentation in the OSM wiki](https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/VIM_emulator).
